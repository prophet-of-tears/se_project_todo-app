# My Todo App

In this project titled My Todo App, I created a simple way for users to organize their tasks so that they can keep up with the busy world around them.

## Functionality

This project lets users input their own tasks in a form and gives them an option of setting a completion time in date format.
after the goal is set, the user has the ability to check the task off, and/or delete the task.

## Technology

the technologies used in this project are:
-HTML
-CSS
-javascript
the Javascript was used to validate forms, provide form popups, and input dates next to the task elements.
